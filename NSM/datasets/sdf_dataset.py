    hashed into it -- means moving your data to another directory silently redraws every
    training sample under the same `random_seed`. The accepted trade-off is the converse:
    re-exporting a mesh with identical geometry but different bytes (a different VTK
    header, different float formatting) does change the seed.

    marker byte instead, so [a, None] and [None, a] still differ. A missing path is not

class SDFSamples(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    """
    Dataset class for sampling SDFs from meshes.

    Args:
        list_mesh_paths (list): List of paths to meshes
        subsample (int, optional): Number of points to subsample. Defaults to None.
        n_pts (int, optional): Number of points to sample. Defaults to 500000.
        p_near_surface (float, optional): Proportion of points to sample near the surface. Defaults to 0.4.
        p_further_from_surface (float, optional): Proportion of points to sample further from the surface. Defaults to 0.4.
        sigma_near (float, optional): Standard deviation/scale of the distribution for points near the surface. Defaults to 0.01.
        sigma_far (float, optional): Standard deviation/scale of the distribution for points further from the surface. Defaults to 0.1.
        rand_function (str, optional): Distribution to sample from. Defaults to 'normal'. Also supports 'laplace'.
        center_pts (bool, optional): Whether to center the points. Defaults to True.
        norm_pts (bool, optional): Whether to normalize the points. Defaults to False.
        scale_method (str, optional): Method to scale the points. Defaults to 'max_rad'.
        loc_save (str, optional): Location to save the cached files. Defaults to
            os.environ['LOC_SDF_CACHE'].

            KNOWN DEFECT, #24: this default is evaluated when the module is IMPORTED,
            so setting LOC_SDF_CACHE afterwards has no effect and the caller silently
            writes to ~/.cache/nsm_sdf_cache. Pass loc_save explicitly.
        save_cache (bool, optional): Whether to save the cached files. Defaults to True.
        load_cache (bool, optional): Whether to load the cached files. Defaults to True.
        random_seed (int, optional): Seeds the sampling, and is part of the cache key.
            Every subject/surface/sigma draw gets its own seed derived from it, keyed on
            the subject's mesh *contents* rather than on list position or path, so neither
            reordering list_mesh_paths nor moving the meshes changes any subject's data.
            Defaults to None, which leaves sampling unseeded -- the historical behaviour.
            Reproducible sampling requires mskt>=0.1.21.
        reference_mesh (vtkPolyData or mskt.mesh.Mesh, optional): Reference mesh to register to. Defaults to None.
        verbose (bool, optional): Whether to print verbose output. Defaults to False.
        equal_pos_neg (bool, optional): Whether to have equal positive and negative SDFs. Defaults to True.
        fix_mesh (bool, optional): Whether to fix the meshes (sing meshfix). Defaults to True.
        print_filename (bool, optional): Whether to print the filename when loading. Defaults to False.

        Notes:
            If reference_mesh is not None, then all meshes will be registered to the reference mesh.
            If equal_pos_neg is True, then the number of positive and negative SDFs will be equal.
            If fix_mesh is True, then the meshes will be fixed using meshfix.
            If print_filename is True, then the filename will be printed when loading.
